# How MAME bezels / overlays work

**Using OrionsAngel overlays**. Others can be more complex.

A MAME overlay is (generally) composed of a LAY file, which describes how the game should be displayed, and images. OrionsAngel also provides a CFG file.

## LAY files

Example of a bare-bone LAY file:

````xml
<mamelayout version="2">
	<element name="foo">
		<image file="foobar_overlay.png" />
	</element>
	<view name="FooBar">
		<bezel element="foo">
			<bounds x="0" y="0" width="1280" height="720" />
		</bezel>
		<screen index="0">
			<bounds x="232" y="54" width="816" height="612" />
		</screen> 
	</view>
</mamelayout>
````

What I assume:

- The `view` defines an entry in the menu, here named FooBar: TAB key in a game > video options.
- I assume the `bezel` coordinates and size more or less define the screen resolution (this element is not documented so good luck).
- The `screen` element defines the position of the emulated machine screen.

So far, pretty simple.

[Full documentation](https://docs.mamedev.org/techspecs/layout_files.html)

Nested elements are relative to their parents:

> Views, groups and elements all have their own internal coordinate systems. When an element or group is referenced from a view or another group, its coordinates are scaled as necessary to fit the specified bounds.

OrionsAngel's bezels don't have children, so I don't care, my head hurts enough.

## CFG files

This file is generated when you open a game in MAME, press the TAB key > sliders > and change values; it can be generated by other actions but that's what's important here.

No documentation exists whatsoever, have fun.

````xml
<screen index="0" hoffset="-0.022000" hstretch="0.530000" voffset="0.072000" vstretch="0.560000" />
````

Try out in MAME:

- **STRETCH** is a value between 0.5 & 1.5
  - 1.0 = full screen image in its original aspect ratio, generally 4/3 (that's important for the rest)
  - 0.5 = image size / 2
  - 1.5 = image size * 2
  - resizes the image **FROM THE CENTER**, the corners move, not the center
- **OFFSET** is a value between -0.5 & 0.5 
  - 0/0 is a centered image
  - (-)0.5 = the **center** of the image is at the edge of the original screen area
  - it's defined **FROM THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN**
  - it's **RELATIVE TO THE FULLSCREEN IMAGE** so a 4/3 game in a 1920x1080 screen is relative to 1440x1080

## Math

Using a bezel configured for a resolution of 1280 x 720

- source lay: (x: 232, y: 54, w: 816, h: 612)
- source offset: (x: 0.022, y: 0.072, w: 0.53, h: 0.56)
- target (measured from screenshot): around (x: 406, y: 233, w: 432, h: 343)

Steps:

- start resolution = bezel x/y/w/h (=> error/warning if x/y != 0)
- apply x/y/w/h from screen.bounds = get base screen position = (x: 232, y: 54, w: 816, h: 612)
- compute original center: cx = x + (w / 2) => (cx: 640, cy: 360)
- multiply w/h by stretch = get target screen size, centered: (w: 432, h: 343) => NEW DIMENSIONS 720p
- compute new base x/y (top/left): x = cx - (w / 2) = (x: 424, y: 188,5)
- apply offset: x = x + ((hres / 4 * 3) * hoffset) ; y = y + (vres * voffset) = (x: 402, y: 240) => NEW POSITION 720p
- apply target resolution (x * 1920 / 1280) = (x: 603, y: 360, w: 648, h: 514) => NEW COORDINATES 1080p
