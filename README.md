# Retropie realistic arcade overlays pack

Overlays (or bezels) are images added "above" the emulator, to mask the black borders around the image.

This pack adds realistic overlays for arcade games.

**Usage of the pack in a commercial product is strictly forbidden.**

## Credits

Please see [credits](CREDITS.md) to check out the awesome original packs I picked from.  
I did mostly nothing except move files around and mess with config files. If you think these overlays are good, please go thank the original authors.

If one of your file is here and you want me to remove it, or want to be credited, please [file an issue](https://github.com/cosmo0/retropie-arcade-overlays/issues).

## Realistic overlays (554 games)

Compilation of "realistic looking" arcade overlays for many games.

It makes your TV look like you're in front of an arcade cabinet. They have screen glare and scratches included in the overlay, and are configured to run with a scanline + curvature shader (zfast_crt_curve).

## Installation

Use the [Retropie Arcade Manager](https://github.com/cosmo0/retropie-arcade-manager/) tool to install these overlays.

## Contents details

It's a mix between [John Merit](https://forums.libretro.com/t/arcade-overlays/4084/), [OrionsAngel](https://www.youtube.com/orionsangel) and [Derek Moore](https://www.youtube.com/user/oldstarscream) works.

The compilation is "complete", and does not care whether the games works on your raspberry pi, needs special hardware (lightgun...), does not work in MAME2003, etc.

However, if a parent game does not work in MAME but one of its clone does, the config files will exist for both games; that's why there seem to be duplicates and clones.
